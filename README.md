# YeezyBot

Automated bot for purchase of Yeezy streetwear


Sportswear, streetwear, and casual fashion is blending with high end fashion. 
Established brands like gucci, versace, off-white, and balenciaga are collaborating on sneakers and hoodies for the first time.
Alongside collaboration, brands are artificially limiting supply of shoes to a period called "drop" -- a predefined date and time for buying said products.
Online retailers sell out of desired "drops" in a matter of seconds. 
The supply-demand gap has created a huge aftermarket/reseller community for these products (similar to concert tickets).


YeezyBot uses selenium webdriver to automate the purchase of Yeezy's off of YeezySupply.com at specified drops

I am publishing the project as is instead of fleshing it out more due to:

1. Market limitations:
  - The Yeezy resale market is depressed by restocks and low demand, demand for this bot is correlated.
  - The field currently has well fleshed out bot products, I cannot compete with them by myself. 
  
2. Technical limitations:
  - The bot is website specific and needs to be continously tweaked to reflect changes that are outside my control.
  
  
This provides a working framework for basing your own bot if you are interested. Included as comments at the end are modifications worth making.
I will be editing components to simplify the code but will not expand on whats already there.
